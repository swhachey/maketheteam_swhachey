## DESCRIPTION

Using the command line we can generate a team consisting of a manager, engineers, and interns. Then the app will generate a HTML page with a visual representation of your team with links to their github pages and email addresses.

---

### INSTALLATION

First install the inquirer module. Then initiate the app by entering node index.js into the command line of your terminal. Then answer the questions and add team members as needed. When done say Finish Team in the menu and the index.html file will be created. Open that to see your team in the browser.
